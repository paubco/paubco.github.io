## About  
MSc in Economics and currently completing a second MSc in Data Science, I’m pivoting into the data-driven world after several years of hands-on experience in the catering industry.

Having recently stepped into the tech space, I bring a diverse background that reflects adaptability and a steadily growing technical skill set. I'm now focused on finding meaningful opportunities that bridge academic learning with real-world impact.

## Projects
**Graph RAG Pipeline for AI Governance Literature**  
*Ongoing - Master's Thesis UOC*  

Designed and implemented a pipeline for Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) using Haystack. Built automated data acquisition workflows integrating the Scopus Search API and ScienceDirect Article API to collect open-access research articles, parse full text and metadata into normalized JSON, and prepare content for knowledge graph construction. Developed methods for entity and relation extraction from scientific text to populate the graph, enabling advanced semantic retrieval and reasoning for research question answering.

**Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) from Scratch**  
*2025 - Universitat Oberta de Catalunya*  

Implemented a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) from first principles using NumPy, including forward pass, backpropagation through time, and autoregressive prediction without relying on high-level frameworks. Results were benchmarked against TensorFlow's SimpleRNN, showing closely matching predictive performance and error metrics.

**Scraping Recipes Project**  
*Ongoing - Universitat Oberta de Catalunya*  

Created a dataset of over fifty thousand well documented recipes using language processing techniques to extract atributes for nutrition, elaboration difficulty. Curretly planning possible usecases for the data such as: adapting recipes for allergies, flavour profile clustering and analysis, etc. 

**Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression from Scratch**  
*2024 - Independent*  

Implemented Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression algorithm including matrix multiplication, transposition and inversion using Gauss-Jordan elimination from first principles using NumPy avoiding reliance on high-level libraries like scikit-learn. Results were crossvalidated against scikit-lean with matching performane.

**Després de les bombes: Urbanisme i especulació en la Barcelona de postguerra**  
*2019 - Universitat de Barcelona*  

Conducted a spatial econometric analysis to examine the long-term effects of bombings during the Spanish Civil War on the urban redevelopment of Barcelona. The study explored how wartime destruction facilitated urban planning and real estate speculation, with a focus on long term effects on turism and housing prices.

**Effects of Literacy on Labour Inequality: Evidence from Spain (1860 - 1930)**  
*2018 - Université Toulouse Capitole*

This econometric study examined the relationship between literacy rates and labor inequality during Spain's economic development in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Focusing on the period between 1860 and 1930, the project used archive data to a how increasing literacy levels helped in reducing wage disparity and access to economic opportunities, shedding light on the broader social and economic implications of education on labor markets during a transformative period in Spanish history.
